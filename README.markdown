#JCHorizontalTableView - iOS / Objective-C View

##About
Seemed like many of my clients desired a horizontal scroll view.  While this isn't too difficult to implement, just loading up a UIScrollView with subviews didn't was not desireable.  This lead me to creating a horizontal table which reused cells similar to the UITableView.  The initial implementation was designed to be scalable, however, it was implemented as a solution to a specific problem.  Hope to improve it over time and with the help of the community.

##How to use
Simply implement how you would any table view with appropriate datasource and delegate implementations.
